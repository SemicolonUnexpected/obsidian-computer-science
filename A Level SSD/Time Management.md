## Planning

- Estimates
	- Provide an estimate for the timeline
	- Compare to previous projects
	- Consult an expert
	- Account for...
		- Size
		- Complexity
		- Team experience
		- Type of product
- Scheduling
	- **Gantt chart**s and **PERT charts** to show...
		- Milestones
		- Task dependencies
		- Important dates
- Risks
	- Unexpected event occur
	- **Buffer** should be built into timeline

## Monitor and control

- **Track** and **record** time spent
- Timesheets
- **Compare** progress with estimates
- Corrective action
	- Add more staff (too much is difficult to coordinate)

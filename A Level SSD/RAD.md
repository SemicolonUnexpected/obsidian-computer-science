*aka. Rapid Application Development*

Compresses the waterfall into an iterative process using prototyping with high user participation.

## How it works

- Functional prototypes developed
	- Multiple may be developed at once to test different parts of the system]
- User evaluates
	- User **feedback** determines the next prototype
- Project iteratively evolves to the final product (cycle)

## Pros

- Less up-front planning
	- Prototyping helps the client express their needs
- Shorter lifecycle
	- **Rapid delivery**
	- **[[CASE]]**
	- **[[JAD]]**
	- **Fourth generation programming languages** to speed up development
- Modular construction
	- Allows parallel development
- Facilitates customer to determine requirements
	- Customer can visually see the system, helping them articulate their needs
- Changing requirements
	- Easily be accommodated in evolving prototypes
	- Solution is more likely to meet user's requirements
	- Problems can be discovered early
- Rapid delivery
	 - High customer involvement ensures requirements met
	 - Encourages system acceptance
- Progress obvious
	- Seen through prototypes
	- Provides assurance
- Continuous integration
	- Reduces risk of poor application architecture
	- Easy to restructure early

## Cons

- Less management control
- Frequent user interaction
- Skilled team
- Poor scalability
- Poor design
- Cost of [[CASE]]

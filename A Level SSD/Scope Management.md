## What is scope?

- Work that needs to be done
- Outlined in [[Project Lifecycle#^756ad2|Terms of Reference]]

## Planning

- Divided work into sections
	- [[Waterfall]] has Initiation, Analysis, Design and Build Implementation, Testing, Implementation/Install and Evaluation
	- [[Agile]] may be broken down into various releases
- Project manager identifies tasks
	- e.g. ER diagram, storyboards
- Milestones
	- Points when progress can be measured and observed

## Monitor and control

*This stage occurs throughout the execution of the project*

- Monitoring and recording work
	- Progress communicated to stakeholders
	- May be recorded on Gantt Chart
	- Corrective action taken if behind schedule (i.e. resource reallocation)
- Control 'Feature Creep'
	- Prevent overrunning budget/time
	- Change Request Forms to change scope
		- Impact evaluated
		- Changes have to be approved
